                            <li>The dragonets consider each other family, more so than their biological relatives</li>

                    <h3>Destiny vs. Free Will</h3>
                    <div class="theme-details">
                        <p>The dragonets are bound by a prophecy that dictates their purpose from before they hatched. Throughout the story, they struggle with the weight of this predetermined destiny and begin to question whether they must follow the prophecy or forge their own path.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Key Elements</h4>

                            <li>The dragonets are raised to believe their sole purpose is to fulfill the prophecy</li>
                            <li>They gradually begin to question the prophecy and their role in it</li>

                        </ul>

                        <p>When Tsunami meets her mother, Queen Coral, she begins to imagine a life in the Kingdom of the Sea, away from the prophecy. This represents her first serious consideration of choosing her own path.</p>
                        
                        <p>Later, when Morrowseer reveals the prophecy is fake, the dragonets must decide whether to continue their mission without the guidance of destiny. Their choice to still pursue peace represents a triumph of free will over predetermined fate.</p>

                        <h4>Key Elements</h4>

                        <p>The contrast between compassionate characters and cruel ones is a recurring theme. The book shows how ignorance kills compassion and how important it is to fight against that ignorance.</p>

                        <p>Each dragonet struggles with questions of identity and where they truly belong. The book explores how identity is shaped by both nature and nurture, and how belonging is about more than just tribal affiliation.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Key Elements</h4>

                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Significant Moments</h4>
                        <p>When Clay briefly meets his siblings, he realizes that while they are his blood relatives, his true family is the other dragonets he was raised with. This represents his understanding that belonging is about bonds formed, not just biology.</p>

                    <h3>Question Authority</h3>
                    <div class="message-details">
                        <p>The dragonets learn to question what they've been told and to think for themselves. The book encourages readers to not blindly follow orders or accept information without questioning.</p>
                        
                        <h4>How It's Conveyed</h4>
                        <p>The guardians who raised the dragonets are shown to be flawed and sometimes wrong. Morrowseer's revelation about the prophecy being fake demonstrates that even seemingly divine guidance can be manipulation. Throughout their journey, the dragonets learn to evaluate information critically and make their own decisions.</p>

                    <div class="message-details">
                        <p>The dragonets repeatedly make choices based on their moral compass rather than what's expected of them. The book shows that doing what's right often requires courage and sacrifice.</p>
                        
                        <h4>How It's Conveyed</h4>
                        <p>Clay demonstrates loyalty by always putting his friends first, even at risk to himself. The dragonets refuse to leave Glory behind when they learn she's in danger. They choose to continue trying to end the war even after learning the prophecy is fake, because they believe it's the right thing to do.</p>

                    <h3>Value Diversity</h3>
                    <div class="message-details">
                        <p>Each dragon tribe has unique strengths and abilities. The book celebrates differences rather than portraying any one tribe as superior. The dragonets' success comes from combining their diverse abilities and perspectives.</p>
                        
                        <h4>How It's Conveyed</h4>
                        <p>Glory's RainWing abilities save the group multiple times, despite RainWings being considered useless by other tribes. Clay's MudWing fire resistance, Tsunami's swimming abilities, Starflight's knowledge, and Sunny's optimism all contribute to their survival in different situations. The book shows that diversity is a strength, not a weakness.</p>

                    <div class="message-details">
                        <p>Despite the bleak war-torn world, the book maintains a sense of hope. The dragonets represent the possibility of a better future, and even when situations seem dire, the characters find ways to persevere.</p>
                        
                        <h4>How It's Conveyed</h4>
                        <p>Sunny's persistent optimism, even in the face of danger and disappointment, embodies this theme. The dragonets continue to believe they can make a difference despite overwhelming odds. The book ends with hope for peace, even though the war isn't yet resolved.</p>

                    <div class="message-details">
                        <p>Characters like Glory and Sunny are underestimated because of prejudices about their tribes. The book teaches that judging others based on stereotypes leads to missing their true value.</p>
                        
                        <h4>How It's Conveyed</h4>
                        <p>Glory, dismissed as a lazy and useless RainWing, proves to be clever, resourceful, and deadly with her venom. Sunny, thought to be weak and naive because of her small size and gentle nature, demonstrates wisdom and moral strength. Peril, feared for her deadly firescales, shows vulnerability and a capacity for friendship.</p>

                    <div class="message-details">
                        <p>The dragonets form a family bond despite not being blood-related. The book explores different types of family relationships, both healthy and unhealthy.</p>
                        
                        <h4>How It's Conveyed</h4>
                        <p>Clay's protective nature toward his friends mirrors his biological role as a bigwings. When the dragonets meet their biological families (Clay's siblings, Tsunami's mother), they realize that their strongest bonds are with each other. The book shows that family can be chosen, not just inherited.</p>
