                    <h3>Prologue</h3>
                    <p>The prologue begins during the War of SandWing Succession, which started after Queen Oasis of the SandWings was killed by scavengers (humans) who stole treasure from her palace. Her three daughters—Burn, Blister, and Blaze—each claim the throne, dividing the continent into three factions.</p>
                    <p>The Talons of Peace, a secret organization working to end the war, gather to discuss the Dragonet Prophecy delivered by Morrowseer, a NightWing. The prophecy states that five dragonets born on the brightest night (when all three moons are full) will end the war and choose the next SandWing queen.</p>
                    <p>Hvitur, an IceWing member of the Talons, attempts to steal a SkyWing egg for the prophecy but is caught and killed by Burn, who also destroys the egg. Meanwhile, Webs, a SeaWing, successfully steals a SeaWing egg from the royal hatchery. Asha, a MudWing, brings a blood-red MudWing egg but dies from battle wounds. Kestrel, a SkyWing, joins them with Hvitur's news of failure. Webs decides to steal a RainWing egg to replace the SkyWing egg, though this substitution isn't part of the prophecy.</p>

                    <h3>Chapter 1</h3>
                    <p>Six years later, the five dragonets—Clay (MudWing), Tsunami (SeaWing), Glory (RainWing), Starflight (NightWing), and Sunny (SandWing)—live hidden in a cave under the Claws of the Clouds Mountains. They are raised by three guardians: Kestrel, Webs, and Dune.</p>
                    <p>The chapter opens with Clay, a MudWing, attempting to escape through a river that leads out of the cave. He gets stuck in a narrow tunnel and is rescued by Tsunami, who is angry that he tried to escape without her. Clay explains he wasn't trying to escape but was following his instincts, feeling something calling him.</p>
                    <p>When they return to the cave, they face punishment from Kestrel, who is particularly harsh with Clay. During battle training, Kestrel forces Clay to fight Tsunami, criticizing his peaceful nature and reluctance to hurt his friend. The guardians constantly remind the dragonets of their duty to fulfill the prophecy and end the war.</p>

                    <p>The dragonets discuss their situation and their desire for freedom. They talk about the prophecy and their role in ending the war. Clay feels particularly protective of his friends, especially Sunny, who is smaller than the others and often picked on by the guardians for not being a "proper" SandWing (she lacks a venomous tail barb and has golden scales instead of pale yellow).</p>
                    <p>Glory, the RainWing who replaced the SkyWing in the prophecy, is treated poorly by the guardians, especially Kestrel, who considers her useless and unworthy. The dragonets, however, defend Glory and consider her one of them.</p>
                    <p>Starflight, the NightWing, shares his extensive knowledge about the war and the three SandWing sisters vying for the throne. Tsunami expresses her desire to escape and see the world, particularly the ocean, which she's never experienced despite being a SeaWing.</p>

                    <p>Morrowseer, the NightWing who delivered the prophecy, visits the cave to inspect the dragonets' progress. The guardians are nervous about his arrival, knowing he has the authority to decide if they're raising the dragonets properly.</p>
                    <p>During his inspection, Morrowseer is visibly displeased with Glory, confirming the guardians' concerns about substituting a RainWing for the SkyWing in the prophecy. He takes particular interest in Starflight, the NightWing dragonet, giving him special attention and instruction.</p>
                    <p>After Morrowseer leaves to confer with the guardians, the dragonets overhear a disturbing conversation: Morrowseer and the guardians decide that Glory must be killed, as a RainWing cannot be allowed to fulfill the prophecy. Kestrel is instructed to kill Glory the next day.</p>

                    <p>Horrified by the plan to kill Glory, Clay and Tsunami decide they must escape with all five dragonets that night. They discover the river Clay got stuck in earlier actually does lead outside, but they need to find a way for all of them to get through safely.</p>
                    <p>Clay volunteers to go first and find a way out. He successfully navigates the underwater tunnel and emerges in a forest outside. However, before he can return to help the others, he encounters Scarlet, the queen of the SkyWings, who is hunting near the mountains.</p>
                    <p>Clay hides, but he's spotted by a strange SkyWing dragonet with unusually bright scales. This is Peril, who has firescales—her scales are so hot they burn anything she touches. Queen Scarlet is using Peril as her champion in arena fights.</p>

Peril's firescales make her nearly invincible in combat, as her touch burns other dragons. Despite her deadly abilities, Clay finds Peril lonely and somewhat naive.</p>
                    <p>When Queen Scarlet approaches, Clay flees back to the river tunnel. He returns to the cave and warns the others about the SkyWings outside. They realize they must leave immediately before they're discovered.</p>
                    <p>The dragonets put together a plan to escape through the river tunnel. Clay and Tsunami help the others through, with Clay discovering he can hold his breath for an unusually long time (a MudWing trait). As they're escaping, they're confronted by Kestrel, but they manage to overpower her and flee into the forest.</p>

                    <p>Free for the first time, the dragonets experience the outside world with wonder and trepidation. They decide to head toward the Kingdom of the Sea, hoping to find Tsunami's family and perhaps allies against the SkyWings who will surely be hunting them.</p>
                    <p>Their journey is cut short when they're spotted by SkyWing soldiers. In the ensuing chase, Sunny and Starflight are captured. Clay, Tsunami, and Glory manage to escape temporarily, but they're unwilling to abandon their friends.</p>
                    <p>They devise a plan to rescue Sunny and Starflight from the SkyWing palace. However, their rescue attempt fails when they're all captured by Queen Scarlet's forces. The queen is delighted to have caught the dragonets of the prophecy and plans to use them in her arena.</p>

                    <p>The dragonets are taken to Queen Scarlet's palace in the Sky Kingdom. They're separated and placed in different prison conditions. Clay, Tsunami, and Starflight are chained to stone spires in the prison area, exposed to the elements. Glory is treated as a piece of art due to her color-changing scales and is forced to change colors for the queen's amusement. Sunny is kept in the palace as a curiosity.</p>
                    <p>Clay meets other prisoners, including Horizon, a SandWing who tells him about the arena fights. He also encounters Peril again, who visits him secretly. She's intrigued by Clay because he's the first dragon who hasn't feared or hated her for her firescales.</p>
                    <p>Queen Scarlet announces that the dragonets will fight in the arena like her other prisoners. Clay is horrified at the prospect of fighting to the death, especially if he might have to face his friends.</p>

                    <p>Clay is forced to fight in the arena against Fjord, an IceWing prisoner. IceWings are natural enemies of MudWings, and Fjord is a seasoned fighter. During the battle, Clay tries to reason with Fjord and avoid fighting, but Fjord is determined to kill him to earn his freedom.</p>
                    <p>As Clay is about to be killed by Fjord's frostbreath, Glory, who is chained nearby as the queen's "art," secretly spits venom into Fjord's eyes, killing him instantly. No one except Clay realizes what happened, and Queen Scarlet is puzzled by Fjord's sudden death.</p>
                    <p>After the fight, Peril visits Clay again. She explains that she's the only SkyWing born with too much fire (firescales), which makes her touch deadly. Her twin brother had too little fire and was killed at birth. Peril's mother tried to escape with her, but Queen Scarlet caught them and forced Peril's mother to kill herself in the arena.</p>

                    <p>Clay learns more about Peril's life in the palace. Despite being feared by everyone, she's loyal to Queen Scarlet, who raised her after her mother's death. Peril believes Scarlet cares for her, though Clay begins to suspect the queen is merely using Peril for her deadly abilities.</p>
                    <p>Peril helps Clay by bringing him food and treating his wounds. She also tells him about the other prisoners, including a SeaWing queen who has been imprisoned for years. Clay realizes this might be Tsunami's mother, Queen Coral.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, Tsunami is forced to fight in the arena. Being a skilled fighter, she survives her battles but is distressed by having to kill other dragons. She also discovers that one of the prisoners is Gill, the former commander of the SeaWing army and possibly her father, though he's been driven mad by dehydration.</p>

                    <p>Queen Scarlet announces a special occasion: Burn, one of the SandWing sisters fighting for the throne, is visiting the palace. Scarlet plans to give the dragonets to Burn as a gift, knowing Burn will kill them to prevent the prophecy from being fulfilled.</p>
                    <p>Clay is taken to fight another arena battle, this time against Tsunami. Both refuse to fight each other, angering Queen Scarlet. As punishment, she forces them to fight scavengers (humans) instead. During the fight, Clay and Tsunami notice that one of the scavengers is wearing Queen Oasis's jewelry, suggesting this might be one of the scavengers who killed the SandWing queen and started the war.</p>
                    <p>After the arena fight, Peril helps Clay meet with the other dragonets in secret. They share information and plan an escape before Burn arrives. Starflight reveals that RainWings can spit venom, a fact that even Glory didn't know about her own tribe.</p>

                    <p>Burn arrives at the palace, and Queen Scarlet shows off the dragonets. Burn is particularly interested in Sunny, whose unusual golden scales and lack of a venomous tail barb make her different from typical SandWings. Burn, who collects unusual specimens, wants to kill Sunny and add her to her collection.</p>
                    <p>Clay is forced to fight in the arena again, this time against Peril. However, Queen Scarlet makes it a special occasion by allowing Clay to use his wings and offering him freedom if he wins (though no one has ever defeated Peril). During the fight, Clay discovers that he's immune to Peril's firescales. They realize he hatched from a blood-red egg, giving MudWings like him special fire resistance.</p>
                    <p>The fight is interrupted when Tsunami causes a disturbance, having freed herself from her chains. In the confusion, Peril helps Clay escape, and they free the other dragonets. However, they're recaptured when Peril betrays them, still loyal to Queen Scarlet.</p>

Peril explains it's a "dreamvisitor," a stone that allows dragons to enter others' dreams. Clay uses it to communicate with Starflight, who reveals he's safe with the NightWings but worried about the others.</p>
                    <p>Burn is scheduled to leave with the dragonets the next day. Knowing they'll be killed, Peril agrees to help them escape during the next arena fight. She gives Clay a mysterious wire that she claims will help free Glory from her chain.</p>

                    <p>Simultaneously, Tsunami breaks free again, and Sunny and Starflight (who has returned with Morrowseer) join the fight. Peril helps Clay by burning through his chains. The dragonets battle Queen Scarlet's forces, with Clay protecting his friends.</p>

                    <h3>Chapter 25</h3>
                    <p>Glory continues her investigation into the missing RainWings. Using her camouflage abilities, she follows a patrol of mysterious dragons who turn out to be NightWings. She discovers they're using a secret tunnel to enter the rainforest and capture RainWings.</p>
                    <p>Glory is nearly captured herself but manages to escape. She returns to the other dragonets with her discovery, confronting Starflight about the NightWings' involvement. Starflight reluctantly admits that the NightWings have been capturing RainWings for experiments, trying to understand their venom and camouflage abilities.</p>
                    <p>The dragonets decide they must rescue the captured RainWings. Glory challenges the RainWing queens to take action, but they refuse, preferring to maintain their peaceful lifestyle rather than risk conflict. Frustrated by their inaction, Glory decides to compete in the RainWing royal challenge, a series of competitions to determine the next queen.</p>

                    <h3>Chapter 26</h3>
                    <p>Glory competes in the royal challenge against the current RainWing queens. The challenge consists of several competitions testing different skills, including camouflage, fruit gathering, and venom-spitting accuracy. Despite the other queens' attempts to sabotage her, Glory performs exceptionally well.</p>
                    <p>During the final competition, a test of tribal knowledge, Glory exposes the queens' negligence regarding the missing RainWings. She wins the challenge and becomes the new queen of the RainWings, promising to find and rescue their missing tribe members.</p>
                    <p>As queen, Glory organizes a rescue mission to the NightWing island. She selects a team including the other dragonets and several skilled RainWings. They use the secret tunnel to enter the NightWings' volcanic island home, where they discover the captured RainWings being held in terrible conditions.</p>

                    <p>On the NightWing island, the rescue team frees the captured RainWings. They discover the terrible conditions the NightWings live in—a barren, ash-covered island with toxic air and little food. The volcano is becoming increasingly unstable, threatening to erupt.</p>
                    <p>They confront Morrowseer, who reveals a shocking truth: the Dragonet Prophecy is fake. He and Queen Battlewinner (the NightWing queen) created it to manipulate the other tribes and eventually take over the rainforest. The NightWings' plan was to use the dragonets to choose Blister as the SandWing queen, as they had a secret alliance with her.</p>
                    <p>The dragonets are devastated by this revelation, realizing their entire lives have been based on a lie. However, they also recognize that even if the prophecy is fake, they still have the power to help end the war and save the dragons of Pyrrhia.</p>

                    <p>The volcano on the NightWing island begins to erupt, forcing an evacuation. Glory offers the NightWings sanctuary in the rainforest, but only if they accept her as their queen and promise to live peacefully with the RainWings. Most NightWings agree, desperate to escape the eruption.</p>
                    <p>During the evacuation, they discover Queen Battlewinner in a hidden chamber. She's been living in a cauldron of lava because she was fatally injured by IceWing frostbreath years ago. The lava keeps her alive by counteracting the freezing effect. When she tries to leave the cauldron to stop the evacuation, the opposing forces of ice and fire kill her.</p>
                    <p>Morrowseer refuses to accept Glory's terms and stays behind on the island. The dragonets and the NightWings who accepted Glory's rule escape through the tunnel just as the volcano violently erupts, presumably killing Morrowseer and any dragons who remained.</p>

                    <p>Back in the rainforest, Glory establishes herself as queen of both the RainWings and the NightWings. She sets up rules for the NightWings' integration into rainforest society and appoints dragons from both tribes to help govern.</p>
                    <p>The dragonets discuss what to do next. Despite learning the prophecy is fake, they still feel responsible for helping end the war. They decide to continue with their mission to choose a SandWing queen, but on their own terms rather than following the NightWings' manipulation.</p>
                    <p>Sunny suggests they try to find a peaceful solution that doesn't involve supporting any of the three sisters. She proposes they look for the Eye of Onyx, a legendary SandWing treasure that supposedly determines the rightful queen.</p>

                    <p>The dragonets prepare to leave the rainforest to continue their mission. Glory decides to stay behind to lead her new kingdoms, but supports the others in their quest to end the war. The RainWings and NightWings begin to work together under Glory's leadership, though tensions remain.</p>
                    <p>Before they leave, the dragonets discuss the prophecy and their role in it. They realize that even though the prophecy was fabricated, they've still managed to fulfill parts of it—they've brought "wings of night" (the NightWings) to the rainforest and helped "darkness rise to bring the light" by exposing the NightWings' deception.</p>
                    <p>Clay, Tsunami, Starflight, and Sunny say goodbye to Glory and set off toward the Kingdom of Sand, determined to find a way to end the war on their own terms. They're no longer following a false prophecy but acting on their own convictions.</p>

She tries again to convince them to choose her as queen, using a combination of threats and promises. The dragonets refuse to be manipulated and manage to escape from her.</p>
                    <p>They continue their journey, discussing possible solutions to the SandWing succession crisis. Starflight suggests they could try to get the three sisters to agree to divide the kingdom, but the others doubt this would work given the sisters' hatred for each other.</p>
                    <p>They decide their best option is to call a meeting of all three sisters and all the tribes, where they can try to broker a peaceful resolution. They send messages to the tribal leaders and the SandWing sisters, inviting them to a gathering at the Great Rock, a neutral location in the Kingdom of Sand.</p>

                    <p>The dragonets arrive at the Great Rock, where representatives from all seven dragon tribes and the three SandWing sisters have gathered. The atmosphere is tense, with ancient tribal enemies forced to be in close proximity and the three sisters glaring at each other.</p>
                    <p>Clay, as the "wings of earth," addresses the gathering, explaining that they want to find a peaceful solution to end the war. He introduces Sunny, who reveals that she's discovered the Eye of Onyx, the ancient SandWing treasure that determines the rightful queen.</p>
                    <p>The three sisters immediately begin fighting over the Eye of Onyx. In the chaos, Burn is killed by a dragonbite viper hidden in a gift from Blister, and Blister is destroyed when she seizes the Eye of Onyx, which kills any dragon unworthy of being queen. Blaze, the last sister standing, acknowledges she's not fit to rule and supports Thorn, Sunny's mother, as the new SandWing queen.</p>

                    <p>With the war over and Thorn established as the new SandWing queen, peace begins to return to Pyrrhia. The dragonets are hailed as heroes who fulfilled the prophecy, even though they know it was fabricated. They decide not to reveal the truth about the prophecy, feeling it would only cause more confusion and potential conflict.</p>
                    <p>The dragonets discuss their future plans. Clay wants to find his siblings in the Mud Kingdom. Tsunami plans to return to the Kingdom of the Sea to help rebuild after the destruction of the Summer Palace. Glory is already established as queen of the RainWings and NightWings. Starflight, who was blinded during the NightWing island evacuation, wants to create a library to preserve dragon knowledge. Sunny plans to stay with her mother in the Kingdom of Sand.</p>
                    <p>Before they separate to pursue their individual paths, the dragonets decide to create a school where dragons from all tribes can learn together in peace. They hope this will help prevent future wars by fostering understanding between the tribes. The book ends with the dragonets looking toward a peaceful future for Pyrrhia, having fulfilled their destiny in their own way despite the prophecy being false.</p>
