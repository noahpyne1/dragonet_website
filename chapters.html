                <h3>Prologue</h3>
                <p>The prologue begins during the War of SandWing Succession, which started after Queen Oasis of the SandWings was killed by scavengers (humans) who stole treasure from her palace. Her three daughters—Burn, Blister, and Blaze—each claim the throne, dividing the continent into three factions.</p>
                
                <p>The Talons of Peace, a secret organization working to end the war, gather to discuss the Dragonet Prophecy delivered by Morrowseer, a NightWing. The prophecy states that five dragonets born on the brightest night (when all three moons are full) will end the war and choose the next SandWing queen.</p>
                
                <p>Hvitur, an IceWing member of the Talons, attempts to steal a SkyWing egg for the prophecy but is caught and killed by Burn, who also destroys the egg. Meanwhile, Webs, a SeaWing, successfully steals a SeaWing egg from the royal hatchery. Asha, a MudWing, brings a blood-red MudWing egg but dies from battle wounds. Kestrel, a SkyWing, joins them with Hvitur's news of failure. Webs decides to steal a RainWing egg to replace the SkyWing egg, though this substitution isn't part of the prophecy.</p>

                <h3>Chapter 1</h3>
                <p>Six years later, the five dragonets—Clay (MudWing), Tsunami (SeaWing), Glory (RainWing), Starflight (NightWing), and Sunny (SandWing)—live hidden in a cave under the Claws of the Clouds Mountains. They are raised by three guardians: Kestrel, Webs, and Dune.</p>
                
                <p>The chapter opens with Clay, a MudWing, attempting to escape through a river that leads out of the cave. He gets stuck in a narrow tunnel and is rescued by Tsunami, who is angry that he tried to escape without her. Clay explains he wasn't trying to escape but was following his instincts, feeling something calling him.</p>
                
                <p>When they return to the cave, they face punishment from Kestrel, who is particularly harsh with Clay. During battle training, Kestrel forces Clay to fight Tsunami, criticizing his peaceful nature and reluctance to hurt his friend. The guardians constantly remind the dragonets of their duty to fulfill the prophecy and end the war.</p>

                <p>The dragonets discuss their situation and their desire for freedom. They talk about the prophecy and their role in ending the war. Clay feels particularly protective of his friends, especially Sunny, who is smaller than the others and often picked on by the guardians for not being a "proper" SandWing (she lacks a venomous tail barb and has golden scales instead of pale yellow).</p>
                
                <p>Glory, the RainWing who replaced the SkyWing in the prophecy, is treated poorly by the guardians, especially Kestrel, who considers her useless and unworthy. The dragonets, however, defend Glory and consider her one of them.</p>
                
                <p>Starflight, the NightWing, shares his extensive knowledge about the war and the three SandWing sisters vying for the throne. Tsunami expresses her desire to escape and see the world, particularly the ocean, which she's never experienced despite being a SeaWing.</p>

                <p>Morrowseer, the NightWing who delivered the prophecy, visits the cave to inspect the dragonets' progress. The guardians are nervous about his arrival, knowing he has the authority to decide if they're raising the dragonets properly.</p>
                
                <p>During his inspection, Morrowseer is visibly displeased with Glory, confirming the guardians' concerns about substituting a RainWing for the SkyWing in the prophecy. He takes particular interest in Starflight, the NightWing dragonet, giving him special attention and instruction.</p>
                
                <p>After Morrowseer leaves to confer with the guardians, the dragonets overhear a disturbing conversation: Morrowseer and the guardians decide that Glory must be killed, as a RainWing cannot be allowed to fulfill the prophecy. Kestrel is instructed to kill Glory the next day.</p>

                <p>Horrified by the plan to kill Glory, Clay and Tsunami decide they must escape with all five dragonets that night. They discover the river Clay got stuck in earlier actually does lead outside, but they need to find a way for all of them to get through safely.</p>
                
                <p>Clay volunteers to go first and find a way out. He successfully navigates the underwater tunnel and emerges in a forest outside. However, before he can return to help the others, he encounters Scarlet, the queen of the SkyWings, who is hunting near the mountains.</p>
                
                <p>Clay hides, but he's spotted by a strange SkyWing dragonet with unusually bright scales. This is Peril, who has firescales—her scales are so hot they burn anything she touches. Queen Scarlet is using Peril as her champion in arena fights.</p>

                <p>Tsunami spends the night guarding her mother's egg in the royal hatchery. She discovers the assassin is a statue in the hatchery—Orca, a deceased daughter of Queen Coral who was an animus dragon (able to enchant objects). Before dying, Orca enchanted the statue to kill all female heirs to prevent anyone from challenging her for the throne.</p>
                
                <p>The statue attacks Tsunami, who fights it off with help from Anemone, who reveals she too is an animus. They destroy the statue, saving the egg, which hatches into Tsunami's new sister, Auklet.</p>
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Clay and the others grow increasingly uncomfortable in the Summer Palace. They discover that Blister plans to imprison them after they choose her as queen. They also learn that Queen Coral has imprisoned Webs, who fled to the Kingdom of the Sea seeking refuge after the dragonets escaped.</p>

                <p>On the NightWing island, the rescue team frees the captured RainWings. They discover the terrible conditions the NightWings live in—a barren, ash-covered island with toxic air and little food. The volcano is becoming increasingly unstable, threatening to erupt.</p>
                
                <p>They confront Morrowseer, who reveals a shocking truth: the Dragonet Prophecy is fake. He and Queen Battlewinner (the NightWing queen) created it to manipulate the other tribes and eventually take over the rainforest. The NightWings' plan was to use the dragonets to choose Blister as queen, forming an alliance that would allow them to claim the rainforest.</p>
                
                <p>The dragonets are devastated by this revelation, questioning their entire purpose. Before they can process this information, the volcano begins to erupt, forcing everyone to flee.</p>

                <h3>Epilogue</h3>
                <p>The epilogue shifts to Burn's stronghold, now Queen Thorn's palace. A mysterious NightWing approaches, seeking audience with the queen. This is Fierceteeth, Starflight's half-sister, who escaped from the NightWing island before the eruption.</p>
                
                <p>Fierceteeth has captured Sunny and threatens to kill her unless Thorn abdicates the throne. However, her plan fails when Thorn's guards overpower her. Thorn orders Fierceteeth imprisoned rather than executed, showing mercy that distinguishes her from the previous SandWing royal family.</p>
                
                <p>Sunny, unharmed, reflects on how far they've come from the dragonets raised in a cave to fulfill a false prophecy. Though their journey wasn't what anyone expected, they've created their own destiny and brought real change to Pyrrhia. The book ends with Sunny looking forward to the opening of their school and the promise of a peaceful future for all dragons.</p>
