                    <h3>Clay (MudWing)</h3>
                    <div class="character-details">
                        <h4>Physical Description</h4>
                        <p>Clay has thick, brown scales the color of mud with amber and gold undertones. He's larger than the other dragonets, with a sturdy build typical of MudWings. His eyes are warm amber, and he has a flat snout with nostrils on top that allow him to breathe while mostly submerged.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Personality</h4>
                        <p>Clay is loyal, protective, and often hungry. As a "bigwings" (first hatched in a clutch), he has natural protective instincts toward his friends, whom he considers his true siblings. He's generally peaceful and tries to avoid fighting when possible, though he will defend those he cares about without hesitation. Clay is also humble, kind-hearted, and sometimes naive.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Abilities</h4>

                        <h4>Background & Role</h4>
                        <p>Clay was born from a blood-red egg purchased from his mother by the Talons of Peace. As the "wings of earth" in the prophecy, he was the first of the dragonets to hatch. Throughout the book, Clay serves as the main protagonist and the emotional center of the group. His journey involves discovering his true nature as a protector and learning about his tribe and biological family.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Key Relationships</h4>

                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Character Development</h4>
                        <p>Throughout the book, Clay grows from feeling inadequate and clumsy to embracing his protective nature. He discovers that what the guardians saw as weakness—his reluctance to fight and kill—is actually a strength. His immunity to fire, revealed during his fight with Peril, symbolizes his resilience and ability to withstand hardship while remaining kind and compassionate.</p>

                    <div class="character-details">
                        <h4>Physical Description</h4>
                        <p>Tsunami has deep blue scales that shimmer with hints of green. She has translucent green eyes and gills on her neck.

                        <h4>Personality</h4>
                        <p>Tsunami is fierce, brave, and often impulsive. She has natural leadership qualities but can be headstrong and quick to anger. She's determined, independent, and not afraid to speak her mind or challenge authority. Despite her tough exterior, she cares deeply for her friends and will risk her life to protect them.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Abilities</h4>

                        <h4>Background & Role</h4>
                        <p>Tsunami is the daughter of Queen Coral, making her a SeaWing princess. Her egg was stolen from the royal hatchery by Webs, a member of the Talons of Peace. As the "wings of sea" in the prophecy, she was raised alongside the other dragonets. Tsunami is often the driving force behind the group's actions, pushing for escape and taking charge in dangerous situations.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Key Relationships</h4>

                        <h4>Character Development</h4>
                        <p>Tsunami's arc involves her discovery of her royal heritage and the realization that her idealized vision of her home doesn't match reality. She learns to balance her impulsive nature with thoughtful leadership and discovers that family extends beyond blood relations to include the dragonets she was raised with.</p>

                    <h3>Glory (RainWing)</h3>
                    <div class="character-details">
                        <h4>Physical Description</h4>
                        <p>Glory's scales can change color based on her emotions or at will for camouflage. Her natural colors tend toward vibrant purples, blues, and greens. She has a slender build typical of RainWings, with a prehensile tail and a ruff behind her ears.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Personality</h4>
                        <p>Glory is intelligent, sarcastic, and determined. She has a sharp wit and often uses cutting remarks as a defense mechanism. Having been treated as a replacement and considered worthless by the guardians, she's developed a tough exterior and a strong desire to prove herself. Despite this, she cares deeply for the other dragonets and will risk herself to protect them.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Abilities</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Can change the color of her scales at will</li>
                            <li>Can spit corrosive venom from her fangs</li>
                            <li>Prehensile tail for climbing and maneuvering in trees</li>
                            <li>Excellent camouflage abilities</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Background & Role</h4>
                        <p>Glory was not originally meant to be part of the prophecy. After the SkyWing egg was destroyed, Webs stole a RainWing egg to replace it. Because of this, Glory was often mistreated by the guardians, especially Kestrel, who considered RainWings lazy and useless. Throughout the book, Glory proves her worth repeatedly, saving the other dragonets multiple times with her quick thinking and unique abilities.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Key Relationships</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Particularly close to Sunny, who was also often underestimated</li>
                            <li>Has a complicated relationship with the guardians, especially Kestrel</li>
                            <li>Develops a grudging respect for Tsunami despite their occasional clashes</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Character Development</h4>
                        <p>Glory's journey is about finding her place and proving her worth. From being considered a worthless replacement to becoming essential to the group's survival, she demonstrates that prejudice about RainWings is unfounded. Her discovery of her venom abilities and her eventual leadership role with her tribe show her growth from an angry, defensive dragonet to a confident leader.</p>

                    <h3>Starflight (NightWing)</h3>
                    <div class="character-details">
                        <h4>Physical Description</h4>
                        <p>Starflight has black scales that sometimes appear dark purple in certain lights. He has a lithe build and silver scales scattered like stars under his wings. Unlike some NightWings, he doesn't have the silver teardrop scales by his eyes that would indicate mind-reading abilities.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Personality</h4>
                        <p>Starflight is highly intelligent and scholarly, with a love for scrolls and knowledge. He's often anxious, cautious, and indecisive, preferring to think through all possibilities before acting. He can be pedantic and sometimes annoying to the others with his constant facts, but his knowledge frequently proves valuable. He's also deeply loyal to his friends, though sometimes conflicted about his tribe's expectations.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Abilities</h4>

                            <li>Can breathe fire</li>
                            <li>Can blend into shadows</li>
                            <li>Night vision</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Background & Role</h4>
                        <p>Starflight is the "wings of night" in the prophecy. His egg was given to the Talons of Peace by the NightWings. Throughout the book, Starflight struggles with his identity as a NightWing, especially when he meets Morrowseer and other NightWings who expect him to be loyal to their tribe above all else. He serves as the group's intellectual resource, often providing crucial information from scrolls he's read.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Key Relationships</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Has a crush on Sunny that he tries to hide</li>
                            <li>Feels pressured by Morrowseer to be loyal to the NightWings</li>
                            <li>Often irritates Tsunami with his caution and indecision</li>
                            <li>Bonds with Clay over their shared love of food, though for different reasons</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Character Development</h4>
                        <p>Starflight's arc involves finding courage despite his fears and learning to trust his own judgment rather than blindly following authority or scrolls. He begins to question the NightWings' motives and eventually chooses loyalty to his friends over tribal expectations. His growth is about finding balance between knowledge and action, thought and feeling.</p>

                    <h3>Sunny (SandWing/NightWing Hybrid)</h3>
                    <div class="character-details">
                        <h4>Physical Description</h4>
                        <p>Sunny is smaller than typical SandWings with golden scales rather than pale yellow. She lacks the venomous barb on her tail that is characteristic of SandWings. Her eyes are a striking green-gray color, and she has a more compact build than pure SandWings.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Personality</h4>
                        <p>Sunny is optimistic, kind, and empathetic. She tries to see the best in everyone and believes strongly in the prophecy and their destiny to end the war. Often underestimated due to her small size and gentle nature, Sunny is actually quite clever and observant. She serves as the group's moral compass and emotional heart.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Abilities</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Can survive in desert conditions</li>
                            <li>Scales radiate heat</li>
                            <li>Enhanced intuition and empathy</li>
                            <li>Can breathe fire</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Background & Role</h4>
                        <p>Sunny is the "wings of sand" in the prophecy. Her egg was taken from her mother, Thorn, by Dune, who was working with the Talons of Peace. Unknown to the guardians, Sunny is actually half NightWing, her father being an animus dragon named Stonemover. This explains her unusual appearance for a SandWing. Throughout the book, Sunny maintains faith in the prophecy and their ability to end the war, often serving as the peacemaker among the dragonets.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Key Relationships</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Particularly close to Clay, who is protective of her</li>
                            <li>Forms a bond with Glory, as both were often underestimated</li>
                            <li>Unaware of Starflight's feelings for her</li>
                            <li>Has not yet met her biological parents in this book</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Character Development</h4>
                        <p>While Sunny's full character development extends beyond the first book, in "The Dragonet Prophecy" she begins to show hints of the strength beneath her sunny exterior. Despite being treated as the weakest link by the guardians, she demonstrates resilience and an unwavering moral compass. Her optimism in the face of adversity becomes a source of strength for the group.</p>

                    <h3>Kestrel (SkyWing)</h3>
                    <div class="character-details">
                        <h4>Physical Description</h4>
                        <p>Kestrel is a large SkyWing with rust-colored scales and scars across her face and talons. She has orange-yellow eyes and a fierce appearance that matches her personality.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Personality</h4>
                        <p>Harsh, strict, and often cruel, Kestrel is the most severe of the guardians. She believes in tough training and has little patience for weakness. Despite her rough exterior, she has a tragic past that explains some of her bitterness.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Background & Role</h4>
                        <p>Kestrel was once a soldier in Queen Scarlet's army. She had twin dragonets: one with too much fire (Peril) and one with too little. Queen Scarlet forced her to kill the dragonet with too little fire and took Peril to raise as her champion. When Kestrel tried to escape with Peril, she was caught and scarred by her daughter's firescales. She joined the Talons of Peace and became one of the guardians raising the dragonets of destiny.</p>

                        <p>Webs is an older SeaWing with blue-green scales that have faded with age. He has a gentle appearance compared to the other guardians.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Personality</h4>
                        <p>Webs is the gentlest of the guardians, though still firm. He's more willing to bend rules than Kestrel or Dune, as evidenced by his decision to steal a RainWing egg to replace the destroyed SkyWing egg.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Background & Role</h4>
                        <p>Webs was once a soldier in Queen Coral's army but defected to join the Talons of Peace.

                        <p>Dune is a SandWing with pale yellow scales. He has a damaged wing that prevents him from flying and a scarred tail where his poisonous barb was cut off.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Personality</h4>
                        <p>Quieter than the other guardians, Dune is stern but not as harsh as Kestrel. He has a particular interest in Sunny, though the reason isn't revealed until later books.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Background & Role</h4>
                        <p>Dune was once a soldier in Burn's army but was maimed in battle, losing his ability to fly and his tail barb. He joined the Talons of Peace and was responsible for finding Sunny's egg. He taught the dragonets about hunting and survival skills.</p>

                    <div class="character-details">
                        <h4>Physical Description</h4>
                        <p>Scarlet has orange-gold scales and amber eyes. She wears jewelry made from the treasures of her defeated enemies and has a regal, intimidating presence.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Personality</h4>
                        <p>Cruel, vain, and power-hungry, Queen Scarlet enjoys watching dragons fight to the death in her arena for entertainment. She's manipulative and sees other dragons as either tools to use or threats to eliminate.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Background & Role</h4>
                        <p>Queen Scarlet is the ruler of the SkyWings and an ally of Burn in the SandWing succession war. She captures the dragonets and forces them to participate in her arena games. She has a particular interest in Clay due to his immunity to fire and his potential as a challenger to Peril.</p>

                    <h3>Peril</h3>
                    <div class="character-details">
                        <h4>Physical Description</h4>
                        <p>Peril has unusually bright copper scales that seem to glow from the heat they generate. Her eyes are bright blue, standing out against her fiery scales. Smoke often rises from her scales when she touches most objects.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Personality</h4>
                        <p>Despite her deadly abilities, Peril is socially awkward and lonely. Having been raised by Queen Scarlet to be her champion, she has little experience with normal dragon interaction. She's loyal to those who show her kindness and desperate for connection.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Abilities</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Firescales - her scales are so hot they burn through anything she touches</li>
                            <li>Immunity to fire</li>
                            <li>Exceptional fighting skills from years in the arena</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Background & Role</h4>
                        <p>Peril was born with too much fire, a rare condition that makes her scales deadly to the touch. Her twin brother, born with too little fire, was killed at birth. Queen Scarlet raised Peril as her champion in the arena after forcing her mother to attempt an escape that resulted in her death. Peril forms a connection with Clay, who is immune to her firescales, and eventually helps the dragonets escape.</p>

                        <p>Brutal, aggressive, and cruel, Burn enjoys collecting "weird" specimens—unusual dragons or animals that she kills and preserves. She's a formidable warrior who rules through fear and strength.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Background & Role</h4>
