                <h2>The World of Pyrrhia</h2>
                <p>The Wings of Fire series takes place on Pyrrhia, a dragon-shaped continent divided into territories ruled by seven dragon tribes. Each tribe has adapted to their specific environment, developing unique abilities and societal structures. "The Dragonet Prophecy" introduces readers to this rich world through the eyes of five young dragons from different tribes.</p>

                <h2>Pyrrhia - The Continent</h2>
                <p>Pyrrhia is a large dragon-shaped continent composed of several different biomes. It is also known as the "Distant Kingdoms" by the dragons of Pantala (another continent introduced later in the series). Pyrrhia is the sole setting of the first ten books in the Wings of Fire series, including "The Dragonet Prophecy."</p>
                
                <p>A large mountain range, the Claws of the Clouds Mountains, runs through the center of Pyrrhia, from the "wing" of Pyrrhia down to its "belly". The largest mountain in the range is Jade Mountain, which becomes significant in later books.</p>

                <h2>The War of SandWing Succession</h2>
                <p>The backdrop of "The Dragonet Prophecy" is the War of SandWing Succession, a conflict that began when the SandWing queen, Queen Oasis, was killed by scavengers (humans) who stole treasure from her. Her three daughters—Burn, Blister, and Blaze—each claimed the throne, leading to a war that lasted 18 years by the time of the book's events.</p>

                    <h3>Impact of the War</h3>
                    <p>The war devastated Pyrrhia, with battles fought across the continent. Many dragons died, territories were destroyed, and resources depleted. The dragonets of destiny were raised specifically to end this war according to the prophecy, though they later discover the prophecy was fabricated by the NightWings.</p>

                <h2>Human Settlements</h2>
                <p>Humans (called "scavengers" by dragons) exist in Pyrrhia but are not a dominant species. They live in scattered settlements and are often hunted by dragons. In "The Dragonet Prophecy," scavengers play a significant role as it was scavengers who killed Queen Oasis and stole her treasure, inadvertently starting the War of SandWing Succession.</p>
                
                <p>During the arena fights in Queen Scarlet's palace, Clay and Tsunami are forced to fight scavengers. They notice that one of the scavengers is wearing jewelry that might have belonged to Queen Oasis.</p>
