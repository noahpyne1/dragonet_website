                <h2>Book Summary</h2>
                <p>"The Dragonet Prophecy" is the first book in the Wings of Fire series written by Tui T. Sutherland. Published in 2012, it introduces readers to the world of Pyrrhia, a continent inhabited by seven dragon tribes caught in a devastating war. The story follows five young dragons—Clay, Tsunami, Glory, Starflight, and Sunny—who are raised in secret to fulfill a prophecy that claims they will end the war and choose the next SandWing queen.</p>
                <p>The dragonets have been raised since hatching by the Talons of Peace, a secret organization working to end the War of SandWing Succession. After six years of training and living hidden in a mountain cave, the dragonets decide to escape their confining home and guardians. Their journey takes them across Pyrrhia, where they face numerous challenges including capture by the SkyWing queen, discovering secrets about their origins, and learning that the prophecy that has dictated their lives may not be what it seems.</p>
                <p>Throughout their adventures, the dragonets form strong bonds with each other, discover their unique abilities and heritage, and ultimately take their first steps toward ending the devastating war that has consumed their world for nearly two decades.</p>

                    When the land is soaked in blood and tears...<br>
